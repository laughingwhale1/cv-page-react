# CV page project. 
The main idea of this project is to show my skills of React by building web page which kinda looks like CV. 

The server side of the app is mocked with **MirageJS** library. 

Client side is built with using: 
###### ✔️ HTML5 as a markup for React components
###### ✔️ SCSS (with BEM methology) for styling
###### ✔️ Javascript (ES6+) 
###### ✔️ React as a bundler
###### ✔️ Redux for global state management
###### ✔️ React router for routing between pages 
###### ✔️ Husky for pre-push testing 
###### ✔️ Redux thunk as a middleware for async actions
###### ✔️ Jest for testing 
###### ✔️ Responsive
